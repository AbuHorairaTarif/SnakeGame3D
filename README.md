<h4>Game concept:</h4>

  Snake 3D Game is a desktop game. The concept of snake movement is taken from
  snake movement algorithm from the internet. We have used Unity 3D, blender etc to
  design the game. 

<b>Game rules: </b>

  Only to buttons are used A an D. For turn left press A, for right press B.
  We have designed only two level.
  First one is Easy and the other is Classic. In easy mode, your game will be finished,
  when you touch the tail of the snake. In Classic, if you cross the boundary and touch
  the tail the game will be finish.

  Lets Enjoy the Game



Problems running Snake 3D:
-------------------------

  -If the snake movement jitters a lot during game play, then Snake 3D is in
   compatibility mode.  Check the intro screen for the reason for
   this mode. Look under VIDEO CARD.

     .
     If your card is too fast, look under DISPLAY in
      the CONTROL PANEL for the refresh rate setting.
     -No Hardware Acelleration: Your current DirectX video card
      drivers do not support hardware acelleration.  Either get newer
      drivers from the manufacturer (web site) or upgrade your
      system to a new card.
   - Use Screen resolution 1280 x 720, graphics quality fast. (Recommended)
